# TiSeLaC-ECMLPKDD17
TiSeLaC ECML/PKDD 2017 discovery challenge solution

The first-place solution to the discovery challenge on time series land cover classification (TiSeLaC), organized in conjunction of ECML PKDD 2017. The challenge consists in predicting the Land Cover class of a set of pixels given their image time series data acquired by the satellites. We propose an end-to-end learning approach employing both temporal and spatial information and requiring very little data preprocessing and feature engineering. 

The architecture ranked first, out of 21 teams, comprises modules using dense multi-layer perceptrons and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks.
